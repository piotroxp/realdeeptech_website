Nature was always interesting to me, and it was always about trying to find beauty in simple things. What happens in the physical realm for us is nothing short of a dream - as it takes about 33 milliseconds for an average human brain to process all the incoming signals.

This blog, however, does not deal with all things natural - I want to keep writing on some of the latest interesting cases of cybersecurity incidents.

Cookie-cutter content doesn't generate leads. Search engines are smarter than ever, and readers have never been as demanding as they are now. To appease them all, you need to be creative, analytical, and customer-centric. Always add something new, put a little twist on it, sprinkle some fairy dust. 

That's where I come in. I'm an experienced creator who makes content that drives marketing results, with 5+ years of experience working with B2B technology companies around the world. I can write content for every stage of your marketing funnel:

* interesting, well-researched long-form articles,
* interviews with experts, 
* outbound email campaigns, 
* captivating social media posts, 
* ebooks, 
* newsletters, 
* sales enablement content, 
* highly converting bottom-of-the-funnel articles.

Technology and science are my favorite topics, but I wouldn't mind writing about other stuff sometimes. I'm passionate about music, philosophy, psychology, sustainable business development, and other cool things like that.
